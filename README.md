WeatherPy

The OpenWeather API data was used to graph the following relationships:

  - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Analysis:

  - Temperature and latitude have very good correlation. The weather becomes warmer as we approach equator and becomes colder as it moves away.

  - There is no relationship between latitude and humidity. But we can notice that there are a large pool of cities of high temperature and with slightly high humidity.  

  - There is no relationship or correlation between latitude and cloudiness. 

  - There is little to no relationship between latitude and wind speed. But we do notice that many of the cities in the northern hemisphere have strong wind speeds than there are in the cities in the southern hemisphere. Wind speed tends to stay between 0 and 12mph whether the cities are located in northern or southern hemisphere.
